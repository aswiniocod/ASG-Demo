# Automate Your EC2 Autoscaling with CodeDeploy and GitHub Actions
This repository provides a workflow template and scripts to automate deployments of code changes to EC2 instances running under an autoscaling group. It leverages the combined power of AWS CodeDeploy and GitHub Actions. 

## Prequisites 

- An AWS account with an EC2 instance running under an autoscaling group.
- A CodeDeploy application and deployment group configured for your EC2 instances.
- A GitHub repository containing your application code.


## Notes 
- This is a basic example and can be customized further based on your specific needs.
- Ensure you have proper IAM roles configured for the EC2 instances to allow CodeDeploy access.
